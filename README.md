# Hands-free computer pointing device
## Engineer's Thesis

Main goal was to design a pointing device for people with motor dis-
abilities of the upper limbs, dedicated to be used with personal computers and construction
of a functional prototype. Device uses head movement tracking and reads electromyographic
voltage from user’s forehead. It is a substitute of generic computer mouse – it has a ability to
move cursor, simulate left and right mouse buttons and scroll pages. Goals were mainly
achieved. With this device, it is possible to handle basic tasks on a computer, although user’s
comfort of use should be improved. 

## Features
- Head rotation is transformed into cursor movement
- Left mouse button click is triggered by frown, by EMG measurement
- Head gestures allow to use right mouse button and scroll
